Breakout Room instructions:

Suppose you have the following puzzle you need to solve. You're going on a journey, and 
you need to select items to put in your backpack. Each item has a certain value that 
increases your probability of surivival. For example, an item with value 5 is more
important for your survival than an item of value 3, and so on. Values are expressed as 
positive integers.

Each item also has a particular weight in pounds. Your backpack can only hold 5 pounds
of survival supplies, and you want to maximize your likelihood of survival, which group
of items will maximize your chances of survival without breaking your backpack.


(Format:"Item: {value, weight}")
- Rope: {3, 2}
- Axe: {4, 3}
- Tent: {5, 4}
- Canned food: {6, 5}

What strategies might you try for deciding how to include items? What happens if you 
always choose to include the item with the highest value that will still fit in your
backpack?
