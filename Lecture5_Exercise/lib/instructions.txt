You've been given a piece of mystery code that deals with vectors and pass-by-reference. Your task is to trace
through the code and identify the state of the data structures at different points on the code.

1. Trace through the execution of the main function in main.cpp but do not run the code.
2. Fill in the provided comments with the state of the data structures at the indicated points in the program.
3.(optional) Once you have completed filling in all the comments and feel confident in your answers, try adding
cout statements to the code to print out the state of the data structures at intermediate points in the program
to check your answers.
