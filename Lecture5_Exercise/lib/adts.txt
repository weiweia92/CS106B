So far, we've learned about four ordered ADTs:
- Vectors
- Grids
- Queues
- Stacks

For each of the following use cases, discuss which ADT you think would be best suited for the job and why:
- The undo button in a text editor
- Jobs submitted to a printer that can also be cancelled
- LaIR requests
- Your browsing history
- Google spreadsheets
- Call centers("your call will be handled by the next available agent")
