Towers of Hanoi goal: Move the disk stack from the first peg (source) to the last peg (destination)
- You can only move one disk at a time
- You cannot place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk (larger disks are represented by larger integers)

===YOUR TASKS===

1. Now that you've seen the pseudocode for the Towers of Hanoi three-disk solution, open 'main.cpp' and fill 
in the 'towersOfHanoiThreeDisks()' function. You should use the provided `source` and `auxiliary` stacks to 
populate the `destination` stack that is passed in by reference.

2. If you finish task 1 and have additional time, discuss strategies for solving `towersOfHanoiGeneral`, which
can take in any number of disks on the source peg.
